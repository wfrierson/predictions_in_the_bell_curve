Overview
***

Despite its publication nearly 25 years ago, the controversial book The Bell Curve (TBC)[^1] has persisted in conversations about IQ. The authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, claim that IQ strongly influences many significant life events -- like whether someone will enter poverty, drop out of school, get married, or even go to jail. Even more contentious, they extend the consequences of low IQ to demographics like ethnicity and nationality. As evidence, the authors build and discuss dozens of probability models using public data. 

Although TBC has been criticized extensively, these responses have mostly come from social psychologists and not statisticians. For this report, I intend to evaluate the statistical meaning of 24 of the nearly 3 dozen models via bootstrap regression. In doing so, I will illustrate the impact of two scientific philosophies, explanation and prediction, in the context of presenting statistical models to the public. I will describe why prediction is the only philosophy relevant to the claims in TBC and, finally, that the 24 probability models are inadequate in supporting the authors’ public policy recommendations.
